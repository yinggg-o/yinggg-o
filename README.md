### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ying.<br>

---
I'm a newly graduated computer science student whose interests in problem solving in general. From web development to data analysis to machine learning, I am constantly learning and expanding my knowledge base. I also enjoy competitive programming and software development.


I have experience developing terminal-based applications for uni assignments to simulate different real-world situations, such as distributed file storage architecture, network routing algorithms. I have also interned in a start-up to develop a machine learning model to forecast sales of a cafe. Iâ€™ve worked on designing and implementing cyber security functionalities for TrackGene as well.

I am always open to collaboration and new opportunities, so feel free to reach out to me!"
